to build moveit for ros-kinetic:

https://moveit.ros.org/install/source/

do upto:
sudo apt-get install python-wstool python-catkin-tools clang-format-3.9

install source and install ccache
no need to do catkin build now ...

now go to:
http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/getting_started/getting_started.html

upto:
sudo apt install ros-kinetic-moveit

if error on unable to fetch obj-recognition-msgs,

do in order: (may be a dependency issue, or the servers were not working in the morning):
1. sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-object-recognition-core
2. sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-object-recognition-msgs

if both install, then  sudo apt install ros-kinetic-moveit installs !

For my slower machine : 

ROS update: Keys have changed recently (June 2019):

http://answers.ros.org/question/325039/apt-update-fails-cannot-install-pkgs-key-not-working/

Remove the old key

    on Ubuntu 16.04 and newer (with ROS Kinetic, Melodic, etc):

    sudo apt-key del 421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116

    on Ubuntu 15.10 and older (ie: 14.04, from here):

    sudo apt-key del B01FA116

Import the new key

This command should work on all versions of Ubuntu:

# add the new key
sudo -E apt-key adv --keyserver 'hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654

--> after this, sudo apt-get update worked (in general), and sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-moveit worked!

DEPENDENCIES for RLL_PLANNER:

I pulled the following (cmake was complaining about rll_msgs):

1. https://github.com/KITrobotics/rll_sdk.git  (this had rll_msgs)  
2. https://github.com/KITrobotics/rll_stack.git 

With this, I was able to build rll_planning_project.
