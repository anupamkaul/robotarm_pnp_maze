A bigger problem on my faster machine (7.28.2019)

With iiwa, kuka etc, the controller manager itself is not seen (maybe it dies and doesnt respawn back)
(rostopic list , rosservice list, rosnode list ... none of them show controller_manager)

(this is after I installed all controllers (from error1.txt)

---

since rospack find controller_manager returns correctly, and rostopic list controller_manager does not, 
it means that probably gazebo_ros_control is not getting loaded correctly (or something happens when it gets loaded)

 <plugin name="gazebo_ros_control" filename="libgazebo_ros_control.so">

this is in:

./src/rll_sdk/rll_description/urdf/iiwa7/iiwa.gazebo.xacro

also looking at:
./src/rll_sdk/rll_gazebo/launch/rll_gazebo.launch
./src/rll_sdk/rll_control/config/rll_control.yaml

Traced that gazebo urdf spawner ALWAYS crashes, no matter what project!
