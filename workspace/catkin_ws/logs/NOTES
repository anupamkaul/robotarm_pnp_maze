Errors:

-- Could not load controller 'PositionJointInterface_trajectory_controller' because controller type 'position_controllers/JointTrajectoryController' does not exist.

-- Action client not connected: PositionJointInterface_trajectory_controller/follow_joint_trajectory

-- Unable to identify any set of controllers that can actuate the specified joints: [ iiwa_joint_1 iiwa_joint_2 iiwa_joint_3 iiwa_joint_4 iiwa_joint_5 iiwa_joint_6 iiwa_joint_7 ]

For solving the unable to load joint_position_controller.. issue

Ref:
https://github.com/qboticslabs/mastering_ros/issues/10

I did:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-joint-state-controller

Result: Not much help, but a new message now:
Unable to identify any set of controllers that can actuate the specified joints: [ iiwa_joint_1 iiwa_joint_2 iiwa_joint_3 iiwa_joint_4 iiwa_joint_5 iiwa_joint_6 iiwa_joint_7 ]

Action: sudo apt-get install ros*controller*   (takes about 900MB as I install every ROS controller!)

Result: Solved ! 

New problem:

-- Controller is taking too long to execute trajectory (the expected upper bound for the trajectory execution was 2.338601 seconds). Stopping trajectory.

I can see the robot now trying to reach to pick the object the 'right way' ... just pauses and freezes and hovers over the object.

--- The MoveItErrorCode execute(const Plan& plan, bool wait) in run_lin_trajectory function (move_iface.cpp) is failing.
A sample code of this function is at: http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/moveit_ros_planning_interface/html/move__group_8cpp_source.html#l00791

Reading Notes for above problem:
--------------------------------

http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/index.html

https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_tutorials/blob/kinetic-devel/doc/move_group_interface/src/move_group_interface_tutorial.cpp
https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_tutorials

The part from the following (from last link above) gets a little more into the meat, but not much.
But, this is a good start, and leads into/from the book studying portion:

"Building more complex applications with MoveIt! often requires developers to dig into MoveIt!â€™s C++ API. As an added plus, using the C++ API directly skips many of the ROS Service/Action layers resulting in significantly faster performance.

Robot Model and Robot State
Planning Scene
Planning Scene ROS API
Motion Planning API    (--> what is of concern)

Of my current interest:

http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/motion_planning_api/motion_planning_api_tutorial.html

- "In MoveIt!, the motion planners are loaded using a plugin infrastructure. This allows MoveIt! to load motion planners at runtime. In this example, we will run through the C++ code required to do this.  ... etc.

https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_tutorials/tree/kinetic-devel/doc/motion_planning_api

(follow this main file: https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_tutorials/blob/kinetic-devel/doc/motion_planning_api/src/motion_planning_api_tutorial.cpp)

Understand this thoroughly, and compare with what's happening / what's missing from the kuka challenge project, to understand why planning execution fails.
